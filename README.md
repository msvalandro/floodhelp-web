# üõü FloodHelp Web

## üìù Description

FloodHelp Web is a project created while studying web3 development during the Web3 Week program by [LuizTools](https://www.luiztools.com.br/). The project consists of a smart contract written in Solidity using the Remix IDE and a frontend dApp built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React Hook Form, and Zod.

The goal of this platform is to enable people to make donations for natural disasters using blockchain/crypto instead of regular payment methods. This approach helps avoid administrative fees from traditional payment platforms, allowing more funds to reach those in need. Users can create donation requests, view a list of existing donations on the home screen, and donate to various campaigns.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Create Donation Requests:** Users can create requests for donations to support natural disaster relief efforts.
- **View Donations:** A list of all donation requests is available on the home screen.
- **Make Donations:** Users can donate to existing campaigns using blockchain/crypto.
